Changelog for version 4.8-git:

* Fixed: now persuasing someone also enquires you to change nickname
* Added colorifying progress of presuasion
* Added attribute coloring (according to how high it is at the moment)
* Added displaying squad's id and name during raids.
* Changed brief view to show more exact numbers of skill progress (to be able to
observe comfortably how your skill grows when performing actions during raids)
* Added current sorting indicator and possibility to toggle between sorting
types with TAB.
* Added 2 new sorting methods: by juice and by skill.
* Added possibility to toggle through squads while equipping (with TAB).
* Fixed not displaying "AWAY" bug when creating a new squad in other location
than currently displayed.
* Disabled multiple city mode. It's a bit buggy and too ambitious,
while confusing and not adding too much value to the gameplay - at least for
now. Probably will be looked at on a later date.
* Added displaying squads' id and number of members in squad review.
* Last found person in daily recruitment menu is approached automatically now. You still
can cancel meeting by pressing "C" in the talk dialog. It has been done to support
holding "B" key to seduce everyone met.
* Added unique id display for squads in Review mode for easier distinguishing
them from each other.
* When toggling through squads with TAB in main window, it will now swap to
list view as well, instead keep zooming n-th member.
* Reordered display of attributes to be more logically grouped (now: Hrt, Wis,
Int, Char, Hlth, Str, Agi) - mental stats first, physical later, Hrt and Wis next to
each other.
* Added current/max recruit counter during meetings next to the name of the recruiter
and lovers counter display next to the name of the seducer.
* Added coloring names of your members according to their juice level for
easier distinguishing them. It's not everywhere, just where it might count.
* Moved the repository from svn to git and cleaned up the history from binary
blobs while at it (reduced size from 300MB to 7.5MB)
* Run astyle on the codebase, rewriting commit history as well, in order to keep
consistent code formatting across all files. Used options can be found in astyle.sh.
* Added CMake build files for *nix systems, right now pretty basic, but getting the same 
functionality as autotools is planned.

New Attack: Sneak Attacks

Sneak attacks are attempted automatically when you attack unsuspecting Conservatives with a knife. You add your stealth to the attack roll, and the victim will defend with their Wisdom instead of their dodge. If the attack is successful, you'll stab the target in the head or body and will usually kill the target instantly. This attack does not cause any alarm if it is successful.

If there are other Conservatives present who are not immediately taken out in the same fashion, your attack is unsuccessful, or the target's armor causes them to survive the attack, the jig is up and the site alarm will be raised. Multiple Liberals can attempt sneak attacks in order to silently take down larger groups of enemies, as long as nothing goes wrong; one failed attack and the rest of your party will have to fall back on traditional knife fighting.

Note that while killing Conservatives in this way may not cause immediate alarm, leaving a trail of bodies is still highly suspicious; you will not have long before the Conservatives figure out something is going horribly wrong, even if they have yet to identify you as the perpetrator. And while this new attack makes knives a very powerful infiltration weapon, sneak attacks can't be used in sieges or any other circumstance where the Conservatives are already alarmed.

* New site tiles, specials, and creature classes to support banks.

* The nuclear plant now has an armory similar to the military base
* Added support for future metal detector checkpoints
* Made skilled Conservatives have different stealth and disguise detection ratings, instead of using one common rating; guard dogs will now be countered by good disguise

New Map Editing
The biggest feature of this version is that maps are now much more moddable, and it's easier for developers to add new maps. It's now possible to use the point-and-click interface of DAME to create new LCS sitemaps, and the game can load these in at runtime. I've created tiles for all the major features and icons representing every kind of unique site action possible, from jury rooms to bouncers to fluffy bunny cages, and proven the system by designing the new Nuclear Plant map.

* cursesmovie.h, cursesmovie.cpp, news.cpp, highscore.cpp, saveload.cpp:
Changed saving and loading to use C I/O with file handle returned by the new

* fight.cpp: You will now only be charged with assault for attacking people who
aren't already hostile to you.

2007-06-23   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>

ChangeLog for Version 3.11.2:

2007-06-17   Jonathan Stickles & Chris Johnson
* baseactions.cpp: Fixed Linux flag burning bug.

2007-06-17   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* lcsio.cpp: Changed mode for read only to actually be read only.
Changed order of art search paths.

2007-06-18   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* fight.cpp: Fixed a sneaky bug in which having high health doesn't protect you
from damage, it protects your opponent from recieving damage from you. Fighter
archetype characters and people with high health stats are now much more
powerful, because they were actually being weakened by their own health rather
than strengthened by it.

2007-06-18   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* src/Makefile.am, f[l]ight.cpp: Renamed flight.cpp to fight.cpp, which it was
supposed to be called. Modified Makefile.am to reflect this change.
* Makefile.am, workspaces/game.cbp: Added workspace for Code::Blocks.

2007-06-19   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* news.cpp, newstops.cpc: Added art for the Liberal Guardian to be
turned into a major newspaper later.

2007-06-19   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* configure.ac, includes.h: Changed version to "3.11.1svn2"
as Jonathan's changes with the art may break compatability with older
versions.

2007-06-19   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* chase.cpp: Fixed a crash bug relating to squad members not being
removed from their squad if killed in a car chase away from their
squad.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* getnames.cpp (enter_name): Added a function to allow a player to enter 
a name. Supports a default value and length.
* includes.h: Added a function prototype for enter_name.
* includes.h: Added a #define called CREATURE_NAMELEN and set it to
the maximum name length. Used this value in declaration of creaturest.
* date.cpp (completedate, completevacation): Used enter_name for name entry.
* haulkidnap.cpp (kidnaptransfer): Used enter_name for name entry.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* includes.h: Added SLOGAN_LEN which is set to the length of the slogan.
Changed the declarations of slogan to SLOGAN_LEN+1, and the declaration of 
name and propername in creaturest to CREATURE_NAMELEN+1. The last character
is for a NULL that will not be overwritten by mvgetnstr().
* basemode/reviewmode.cpp: Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr to prevent overflows
of the creature's name.
* basemode/baseactions.cpp: Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr to prevent overflows
of the slogan.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* reviewmode.cpp (review_mode): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* baseactions.cpp (getslogan): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* newgame.cpp (makecharacter): Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr and terminated
string to prevent overflow.
* commondisplay.cpp (fullstatus): Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr and terminated
string to prevent overflow.
* getnames.cpp (enter_name): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* includes.h: Took away the +1's as they are no longer needed.

2007-06-21   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* reviewmode.cpp, baseactions.cpp, newgame.cpp, commondisplay.cpp: 
mvgetnstr does not work with my PDcurses, and I am assuming that other people
will have trouble as well. I changed everything from my previous change to use
enter_name for string entry.
* includes.h: Changed SLOGAN_LEN to 79. I think that the code that centers 
the slogan on the screen can not handle a slogan that is 80 chars long, as 
that is the size of the screen. No crashes for the slogan now.

2007-06-21   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* game.cpp, includes.h: Created function called end_game which will clean up
memory and close the game to prevent memory leaks.
* lcsio.cpp: Fixed lcs_home memory leak by freeing and reallocating it each 
time it is needed.
* titlescreen.cpp, commonactions.cpp, endgame.cpp, monthly.cpp: Modified
some of the exit code to use new end_game function.

2007-06-21   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* game.cpp, includes.h: Redefined all slogan vars to have length SLOGAN_LEN+1.
The save/load system does not like 79 byte slogans. The other code
that sets slogan still uses SLOGAN_LEN, so only 79 bytes will be shown.

2007-06-22   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* extern.h, game.cpp, includes.h, activate.cpp, baseactions.cpp, basemode.cpp,
commondisplay.cpp, activities.cpp, siege.cpp, monthly.cpp, saveload.cpp:
Continuation of the ongoing massive overhaul of the Liberal Guardian design.
This may be the final design for the system for now.
* commonactions.cpp, activities.cpp, lcsmonthly.cpp, miscactions.cpp:
change_public_opinion no longer has a default cap of 10 points of public opinion
shift per call. Formerly this cap was changable through an optional fourth
parameter. Now the fourth parameter is the maximum to increase public opinion
to, and defaults to 100. Calls throughout the code changed appropriately.
* news.cpp: Changed the way the public opinion changes from news stories and
site actions is calculated.
* commonactions.cpp, siege.cpp: Changed the way law enforcement "heat" is
calculated.
* justice.cpp: Changed the way the strength of legal prosecution is calculated.
* monthly.cpp: Changed the way public opinion drifts are calculated.
* news.cpp: Unlawful entry no longer generates a news story.
* game.cpp, includes.h: Moved debug defines from game.cpp to includes.h.
* includes.h: Advanced version to 3.11.1svn3. Old saves are now obsolete.

2007-06-22   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* includes.h: Changed version of lowest save to 3.11.2.

2007-06-22   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* chase.cpp: The cops now play mercifully nice. You can always pull over or give
up in a police chace, even if you start shooting earlier in the fight. You still
can't surrender to death squads or non-police enemies.
* chase.cpp: Changed the driveskill calculation. Driving skill is now more
important. The speed of your car is also more important. Having an injured
driver is now very bad. Shooting the enemy driver is now very good.
* justice.cpp: Tweaked the way scarefactor works in court again.

2007-06-23   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* lcsio.cpp: Added ../art to the art search path. Forced Windows to search
../art as well.

2007-06-23   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* justice.cpp: You can now be charged with multiple counts of the same crime.

2007-06-23   Chris Johnson & Jonathan Stickles
* chase.cpp: Fixed bug #1741974, Hostages not freed if arrested during
car chase.
* haulkidnap.cpp: Added new situation to freehostage to not print anything.


RELEASE VERSION 3.11.1:
Fixed crash when squad is disbanded.
Split up game.cpp into smaller files.
Support for GNU Autotools

Changelog version 3.10

--- COMBAT & FIGHTING:
* Ballistic vests that provide the strongest armor yet, and can't be made or bought, but are carried by military and some police forces
* Raids conducted by special Police SWAT units with machine guns and body armor (Trivia from the SWAT entry on Wikipedia: In the SLA siege, the police eventually assaulted the building with teargas and SWAT units armed only with semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, and no body armor. The building burned down, all of the SLA members inside were shot multiple times, and despite over three thousand rounds fired and the police not using body armor, not a single police officer was injured.)
* Back ranks during a siege are less effective (must pass an agility check to attack)
* Assault rifles can hit more than once per round
* Just a little less likely to hit Liberal bystanders on accident... it's not really fun to have to always be holding your fire when fighting
* Shotguns are easier to hit with, but do reduced damage on a "barely hit"
* Mere pistols no longer blow people's limbs apart with a single bullet (I lost one too many main characters to security guards BLOWING MY BODY IN HALF with the first shot from their .22 revolver), but may still get other critical hits ("heart is blasted!" and dead at the end of the round, broken neck and paralyzed, all those other uncool other things that don't involve decapitation, exploding bodies, or outright dismemberment that is vastly out of proportion to the power of the weapon used)

--- SLEEPERS:
* Sleeper system overhaul -- eliminating the early News Anchor/Radio Personality win without making them useless, by having them all influence the normal background moves of public opinion, rather than have their own independent effect
* Make almost all sleepers good for something, except like, police dogs and mutants
* Police department sleepers can give advance warning of police raids and leak police records
* CEO sleepers may warn of imminent corporate attacks and leak corporate documents (corporate managers can also leak documents)
* Agent sleepers may warn of imminent CIA raids and leak intelligence documents

--- LEGAL SYSTEM:
* Hiring a good attorney costs $5000 instead of $1000
* Getting away with murder (literally and metaphorically) in court is generally harder; prosecution is stronger, and how many (and how bad) the charges are influences the difficulty
* Sleeper judges always reduce the sentence, and never order executions
* There's always a chance of conviction, even if you're really good; you're guilty, it should never be a sure thing to get away with it. Instead, emphasis should be on avoiding that position in the first place.

--- HACKING:
* Harder to get a "major event" in hacking
* Can cause a scare by hacking into CIA networks (don't get data disks, but you do influence the intelligence issue)
* Can deface conservative websites
* Credit card fraud is less lucrative for lower level hackers

--- DATING:
* Law enforcement officers and agents sometimes identify wanted Liberals on dates, and try to arrest them
* Kidnapping soldiers and other dangerous targets can sometimes backfire

--- COMMAND STRUCTURE:
* Liberals stay in contact when their boss is only arrested, and only disappear when their boss gets sent to jail or dies
* High juice, high heart liberals might come back after their boss is released from jail (so maybe you're sent to jail for twenty years, and awhile after you're released, one day your old top general just shows up at the homeless shelter, weapon in hand... everyone else has abandoned you, but she's a veteran with too much put into this... even after twenty years, the man can't keep her down)
* Color coding on the promotion screen to show which liberals are arrested, in jail, or in hiding due to their superiors being in jail

--- OTHER STUFF:
* Armor can only be sold at the cost of manufacture (can't sell expensive suits to raise money)
* The keys '/' and '\' can be used to page forward and back instead of brackets or pageup/pagedown, by typing "slashes" into the init file

3.10a1

* I re-doubled the selling price on armor, so that it's now twice the manufacturing price, rather than merely the manufacturing price. So now you can still make a profit from making expensive suits, it's just much less attractive than it used to be -- $300 per suit profit is less useful than $1200 per suit.
* No agility check to give cover fire in sieges
* / and \ support in init file removed; AZERTY support added

3.10a3

* General balance changes.
* Police now search for safe houses differently.
* Added a prototype system for writing articles for the Liberal Guardian.
* Added various new weapons.

3.10a5

* A pause before you get into encounters
* Stuff appears in restricted squares
* New law: Gun control
* Pawn shop now sells more guns, but only if they're legal
* You can now cause alarm by the weapon you're carrying
* You can now cause instant alarm as soon as anybody sees you if your weapon is totally illegal, like walking into the police station with an AK-47 and a clown suit
* You can get thrown in jail for openly carrying an illegal weapon in public
* You can disguise yourself and get away with holding an illegal weapon
* "Massive Conservative Response Imminent"

Older changes are too conservative.
